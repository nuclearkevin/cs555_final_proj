# CS555 Final Project

This repo contains my final project for CS 555 (Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations) at UIUC, where I implemented the discrete ordinates ($S_N$) method for solving the linear Boltzman equation with isotropic external and scattering sources. The implementation is tested against the 1D Reed benchmark problem:

The Jupyter notebook implementing the method (and describing it) can be found in `1D_sn_miniapp.ipynb`. My slides for the presentation given can be found in `/presentation/*`.
